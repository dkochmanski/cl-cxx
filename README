CL-CXX
======

This is a C++ library that interfaces to any Common Lisp implementation,
where "any" right now means basically ECL.

The core of this library is based on ideas from boost::python, though
written from scratch, with a little less template magic and looping and
ensuring that the backend remains portable enough to be adapted to any
Common Lisp implementation.
